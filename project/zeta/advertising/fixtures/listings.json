There are a gazillion cafes/bars/supermarkets right downstairs and weekend markets across the road. A pleasant walk by the water takes you to the art gallery, botanic gardens and opera house. The apartment is on the border between the red-light district (home to some hard characters, weekend party-goers and backpackers) and the gentrified part of the neighbourhood (the 'Paris end' of Potts Point). The 1937 building, originally nurses quarters, definitely needs a facelift but retains its period charm. My flat is renovated so feels fresh. The bathroom has been brightly painted since the photos but the shower temperature is tricky to get right so I often took baths living there, and the bath is nice and deep. Nestled between other apartments overlooking the high street and rear laneway, my flat is on the first floor and faces into a lightwell. This means there is no grand vista but also no street noise, and it's temp", "notes": "I provide instructions on how to treat spills like red wine, coffee etc. as I have a light-coloured rug and couch that I quite like. Taking the rubbish out involves going down a rather dingy back-of-house restaurant passage but you do pop out into the rear laneway where folk in their tortious-shell sunglasses perch on small furniture sipping coffee. The wi-fi provided does the basics but is only 4G, not a landline modem. For higher speed service there are late night places just downstairs - cafes, Kings Cross library and backpacker travel booking spots with free computer use.", "neighbourhood_overview": "I love the harbour-side walk to the Andrew Boy Charlton swimming pool, across the water from the strangely beautiful naval base. The Saturday food markets have a great vibe (I recommend The Butchers Table stall sandwiches and the Vietnamese salads and pho) and the patisserie right next door does amazing chocolate mousse cake and croissants. If you exit the back door of the building you open it onto a tiny hole-in-the-wall cafe called Room 10 which does excellent, and marvellously convenient, coffee. Bourke Street Bakery has underground seating which is warm in winter and cool in summer. The walk to Beare Park on the water takes you through residential streets with nice art deco architecture and past the historic Elizabeth Bay House, which itself has a lovely public garden across the road - both good spots for a picnic. Rushcutter's Bay is a more expansive park, good for jogging, frizbee, playgrounds etc. For brekky I go to a cafe behind my building called Petrol (terrible name, slow se", "transit": "FROM THE AIRPORT Shuttle bus - When you exit the airport doors, go all the way to your right, to the shuttle-bus area, and ask for a bus to the corner of Macleay and Orwell Streets, Potts Point - or to the Kings Cross Fountain. You don't need to book. There are a few independent operators of the service and their prices are competitive with the train (around $21 for an adult - don't worry, most train rides cost less!) Train - You need to change to platform 24 at Central Station and continue on to Kings Cross Station - it is then a 3 minute walk.  Taxi - around $60-$70 I believe PUBLIC TRANSPORT FROM THE FLAT Visit the transportnsw website to plan journeys. Buy an opal card with, perhaps, $20 credit from a train station or newsagent. Use this card to tap-on and tap-off train, bus and ferry journeys. Maximum charge is $15/day and $2.50 on Sundays.  The neighborhood is very convenient and central in terms of public transport.

If you're looking for space, privacy (within a shared house) and great value for money, this room ticks every box.  The house is fun without being party central. We respectfully share with each other and many friendships have been formed here. Most evenings, I can be found in the kitchen, cooking up a storm, inviting you to eat, eat, eat!! I enjoy warm lively conversation over a glass of wine or a cup of morning coffee and love hearing about the day's adventures as Sydney is explored! I don't intrude past hello if you don't look like you want to chat. Often I'm just running out the door, running late to the next thing. We have ADSL2+ wifi internet access.  Your room comes with fresh bedlinen and towels, beach towels, a fan over warmer months, heating over cooler months, extra blankets if you need them.  The house has a fully equipped kitchen including a coffee machine and a pantry full of communal items that I encourage you to take before doin", "notes": "Come and stay in wonderful Petersham! This amazing and large terrace house is located only minutes from the train and buses that will have you in the heart of the city within 15 minutes.

The room is perfect for a couple or single and is easily accessible to the shared bathroom. We are very close to public transport (and even a pub next door) but it is quiet and relaxed so no need to worry about noisy trains waking you up at night!). We are a short walk away from Leichhardt which is Sydney's amazing Italian dinning and entertainment precinct. On the other side of the railway line is Petersham's famous Portuguese dining strip. Glebe, Balmain and Rozelle markets are a short bus trip away. This is a lovely and safe area to walk around at any time of day or night.

This sweet space is ready to go in an authentic Sydney workers cottage in a quiet cul-de-sac so close to the city yet so very far away in feel! Come and enjoy this divine space! The studio apartment has rustic lime-washed wooden floorboards, high ceilings, a large recently appointed bathroom and a very comfy queen bed. The living/ bedroom is approx 10 metres x 4m  with two big wooden windows, a comfy sofa, small fridge, kitchenette incl electric oven, cooktop and microwave. Cosy rugs(all linens and crockery etc provided...just bring your suitcase!) add a warm touch. The space has been very nicely decorated (I am an ilustrator/designer and the house has been photographed over the years for several magazine spreads) and is a real home away from home with a big wardrobe to stash your stuff. Just 10 metres from the house is a wonderful little park (O'connor Reserve) which you walk through to the zillion buses that can take ", "notes": null, "neighbourhood_overview": "Rozelle is a great little neighbourhood, pubs and cafes on just about every corner, shops a 5 min walk away, gorgeous rambling parks and lots of arty haunts - including one of sydney's best 'flea markets' on the weekends, a 5 min walk away!.
