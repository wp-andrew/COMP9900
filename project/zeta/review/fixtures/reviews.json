Here are his comments : )\n\nKevin\u2019s house is a spacious apartment with a open kitchen and a big living room. \nI have had a pleasant and comfortable stay in his apartment.\n\nI was living in a room which is clean and well maintained. The bed is big and comfortable which was able to give me deep sleeps all along the stay. The room also has a big wardrobe and I can put plenty of clothes inside. There is a big window as well so the room is full of sunshine and well ventilated. Curtain is available if you would like to keep your privacy or shield the sunlight. There are also 6 sockets and a fan to use.  \n\nThe toilet is spacious and clean as well. Toilet paper and handwash are provided. The shower is also functioning well and providing plenty of  warm water. Just mind your steps as the bathtub might be slippery and there are no handrails nearby. \n\nThe kitchen is free to use. You can share the refrigerator and store some foods. You can also do your laundry with assistance from Kevin.\n\nKevin is nice guy and always willing to provide help. He was also doing his work quietly so you can have a calm and peaceful environment to rest. You can also provide some food residues to him to contribute some fertiliser to his Eco-friendly garden. I think both Kevin and his lovely plants will thank you. \n\nThe location is okay as it only takes 10 mins walk to Redfern which is close to Sydney\u2019s major travelling spots like circular quay or central station, and also convenient to Fish market or Bondi beach. \n\nThere are also some coffee shops outside the station providing excellent breakfasts. I recommend the Gibbon street Cafe as they really provides seriously good coffees. The dishes were also amazingly designed and wonderful. You must have a go!\n\nOverall this apartment is highly recommended. Just one important point to know is you are provided a key that can open both Kevin\u2019s apartment and the building entrances, with the same key! So by logic anyone (like other residents) able to open the building entrances can also open Kevin\u2019s apartment and creates possible security problems. Feedback from Kevin was no problems happened in his 10 year stay.

Our room was a private room on the bottom floor of her very stylish two-story apartment (her apartment is on the 4th floor of the building). We also had our own bathroom directly outside of the bedroom. Upon checking in, there was a fantastic written guide that gave us details on the area, local restaurants, things to do etc. It also gave information on using the common area balconies in the house, use of her kitchen, and some information about her little dog Charlie. In her guide, we found she communicated everything effectively and we had everything we needed to comfortably live during our week-long stay. Morag also offered many little extra perks that were extremely gracious. She provided pastries in the morning, we had gourmet coffee on her Nespresso, all bathroom amenities were supplied, and she even left some Opal cards (local ferry, bus, train, mass transit card) for us to use as long as we just \u201ctopped them off\u201d after we used them. It made our lives so much easier. Although we needed to coordinate the use of the kitchen and the upstairs balcony, Morag let us know the times she\u2019d be home so we had full access to both of these a lot of the time. She was extremely mindful of privacy but still was kind enough to answer a few questions we had during our stay (although her guide really gave us most of what we needed). The location of her apartment is outstanding. A 10 minute walk one way and we were in Kings Cross. A 10 minute walk the other way and we were in Hyde Park. A 10 minute walk another way and we were right at the Bay. To get to the train is a 10 minute walk and the store is a 5 minute walk. If we were wanting convenient restaurant or stores, there\u2019s a dozen options all within 2-3 blocks.

The bathrooms themselves are a bit dated, but work and function just fine. It was nice having two of them. Tons of extra linens too! They had a great setup with a TV and sound to enjoy in the evenings. The patio had a gas grille and a great setup to just sit out and relax. I can only imagine what a great view this apartment has on New Year's eve.\n\nThe area itself is up and coming and clearly going through a resurgence which makes it colourful with lots of food choices, shopping and the sights a short distance.  As other people have commented, the picture of the views don't quite do this space justice. \n\nIt really is a fantastic central spot, close to King's cross station too. A safe building with two secure entry points - we had no issues. Note: There is no lift, but Dan went above and beyond and helped us upstairs with all of our luggage! Thank you!\n\nThoughtful touches:\nWe had two young children, 3 and 2 and Dan and Jade even ensured there was a portable baby crib and sheets/comforter for us so we could stay in comfort. They provided all the essentials for shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer and even some milk, cold water and washing supplies for the washer/dryer. A well stocked apartment indeed! Dan even dropped by some additional washing liquid as they had run out to make sure we could use everything.\n\nThe kitchen has been well updated and has an essential dishwasher. They have everything you need to cook in addition to kids plasticware. Also, plenty of cooking oil, spices, S&P, bags and anything else you would need. All in all a very nice space if you're looking to stay in a central Sydney location! \n\nBill's for breakfast is HIGHLY recommended as is the Bunker. Trendy and amazing food! Even kid friendly and about a 10 minute walk. Highly recommended and thank you again for the wonderful trip and all the suggestions! \n\nBest, Kim & Paul", "submitted_on": "2018-04-18"}}, {"model": "review.Review", "pk": 255873111, "fields": {"id": "255873111", "review_type": 0, "provider_id": "425305", "visitor_id": "52462965", "listing_id": "79024", "rating": "89", "content": "Everything about this apartment was wonderful.

Erst lesen.\nDO NOT BOOK, before you read this. (translate it from german to english)\n\nWir waren vom 29.12. - 31.01. \u00fcber Silvester in dieser Wohnung. Mussten unseren Aufenthalt nach 3 N\u00e4chten von 6 abbrechen, da die Wohnung eine reine Zumutung war.\n\n- in der Wohnung sowie AUF DEM BETT gab es K\u00dcCHENSCHABEN (Fotobeweis existiert)\n\n- KEINE KLIMAANLAGE. Bei 30-35 Grad kein schlafen m\u00f6glich.\n\n- Bad ist dreckig, vor allem Badewanne & Waschbecken. Wurde vermutlich nie richtig gereinigt.\n\n- Flur (au\u00dferhalb Wohnung) stank nach Urin.\n\n- SCHL\u00dcSSEL befindet sich komplett an einer ANDEREN ADRESSE. Viel Spa\u00df mit 3 Koffern.\n\n- Wohnung befindet sich n\u00e4he ROTLICHTVIERTEL.\n\nDas war bis jetzt meine schlimmste Erfahrung bei AirBnB. Wenn man die Wohnung ggf. f\u00fcr 60 EUR / Nacht erh\u00e4lt, dann kann Sie OK sein. Denn Sie ist etwas besser als ein altes billiges Motel, aber wir hatten 180 EUR / Nacht daf\u00fcr bezahlt und daf\u00fcr war es eine reine Abzocke.\n\nUnabh\u00e4ngig der oben genannten Punkte kam hinzu, dass der Gastgeber Tobias auf Kritik \u00fcberhaupt nicht eingeht. Als ich ihn z.B. bzgl. der Schl\u00fcssel\u00fcbergabe und meiner 3 Koffer informiert hatte, hat er mir einfach nur Empfohlen doch ein Taxi zu nehmen und zu der Schl\u00fcsseladresse zu fahren und dann zu der eigentlich Wohnung. Was nat\u00fcrlich meine Reise verteuert als geplant. Als ich Tobias \u00fcber die Probleme und Unzufriedenheit bzgl. seiner Wohnung  informiert hatte, hat er nur gesagt, dass ich doch gerne fr\u00fcher abreisen kann, aber keine Buchungs\u00e4nderung oder R\u00fcckerstattung f\u00fcr die ungenutzten Tage vornimmt. \n\nNach unserer Abreise hat dann Tobias, 8 Tage nach unserem fr\u00fchzeitigen Check-Out behauptet, dass wir noch seinen Router besch\u00e4digt h\u00e4tten. Der AirBnB Kundenservice hat zurecht seine Forderung abgelehnt sowie uns dann im Nachhinein f\u00fcr die 3 N\u00e4chte die wir zu fr\u00fch die Wohnung verlassen hatten entsch\u00e4digt. Zum Gl\u00fcck hatte ich alles dokumentiert. Tobias hat sich halt gedacht, \"oh \u00fcber Silvester nehmen alle min 180 EUR / Nacht, dann mach ich das mal mit meiner dreckigen Ghetto Wohnung auch..\" Und war dann wohl verwundert, dass man bei 180 EUR / Nacht gewisse Erwartungen erf\u00fcllen muss. Egal was er hier als Gegenantwort schreibt, es wird eine L\u00fcge sein wie mit dem Router. Ich habe FOTOBEWEISE. Gerne kann man mich anschreiben, falls man diese haben m\u00f6chte.\n\nICH KANN NUR ABRATEN DIESE WOHNUNG ZU BUCHEN! Warum diese Wohnung soviel positive Bewertungen hat kann ich nicht verstehen. Ggf. weil die meisten nur 60 EUR / Nacht gezahlt hatten, dann w\u00e4re es noch irgendwie nachvollziehbar.

The local area is fabulous (great coffee place just across the park that also serves lovely food!) and easy accessibility (walkable) across the harbour bridge into the CBD/rocks area.

Things we really liked:\nLocation - perfect. Just over 5 minutes walk and you are in the heart of Darling Harbour. Lots of bus services on Harris Street just one minute walk. And The Light rail stations at Conference Centre and Convention are only 5 minutes away. Get an Opel card for all of these sevices (and the ferries) and Sydney is your oyster! There are a couple of local supermarkets just a few minutes walk along Harris Street.\nThe Apartment - ideal for two people (though be aware that you have to be mobile. 43 stairs up from the street and there is no lift). Good size lounge and bedroom. Kitchen is large as is the bathroom / shower room / laundry area. \nRoom fans and air conditioning make it very comfortable even at the height of summer. Australian tv is rubbish unless you like adverts, so it was great to have Netflix to chill out on after a day in the city.\nThings that weren't quite right:\nThe directions given on Airbnb are totally inaccurate. Ada Place is split into two totally different streets separated by over 200 metres. There was no apartment number given on the Airbnb website and we arrived at the wrong Ada Place. It took us 90 minutes and several phone calls to the vendor to get access at the right place. Ultimately the girl from Beachside Breaks had to make a 30 minute journey to take us to the right part of Ada Place. Lloyd at Beachside has told me they will sort this problem out.\nThe apartment needs a wee bit of tlc. The furniture is comfortable but the couch needs cleaned. The kitchen is a great size and well equipped but the oven and hob are ancient. The oven is almost unusable because the door is hanging off. This all needs replaced. The shower is a great size (and powerful!) but the bathroom does need re-tiled / re-decorated.\nAll in all, the positives out-weighed the negatives.

Sometimes she rents the whole apartment, but when I was there she stayed in the master bedroom and I was in the double-bed guest bedroom with its own little balcony (read the ad; there's also a queen-bed guest room without balcony; it's all very carefully spelled out and Ratih is an excellent communicator). The apartment is spacious and immaculate with stunning views, it's conveniently and comfortably laid out, I found it very private since nobody was staying in the other guest bedroom, and above all, I loved getting to meet Ratih herself, who is a considerate and personable host as well as an avid traveler. The internet worked great, I washed and air-dried laundry with minimal fuss, and Ratih let me park a car in the building garage for $30/night which is very reasonable compared to the going rate in Sydney. (My boyfriend joined midway through my 4-day stay and that was an additional $30/night.) In response to some of the earlier reviews -- be advised that Sydney is an expensive, sprawling city and this is one of the more upscale/newly rebuilt neighborhoods, but it's very scenic, spacious, and a nice base if you are spending time in the CBD or anywhere within shot of the light rail. I stayed in 2 other places in Sydney and this was the best value and the most at home I ever felt thanks to Ratih's exceptional hospitality. It will be my first choice next time I'm in Sydney.

Make sure you have coins for the laundry! 3 dollar for 1 laundry wash and an other 3 for drying. Bus 333 and 380 outside your door will take you all the way in to town and the warf where all the boats go. Very convenient. Bondi is such a nice neighborhood- we really loved it!

Some parts of Kings Cross are  bit dodgy but the walk from the Station to the apartment is fine. You can also walk though the Botanical Gardens to Circular Quay or the Opera House in about 30 minutes at a leisurely pace. There are a few restaurants / pubs very close by, and more up towards Kings Cross. No lack of dinging options, and a supermarket very close. The swimming pools in the Botanical Gardens are superb. There is a kids playground and a tennis / basketball court very near.\n\nApartment - It's safe and secure with all the amenities you would expect. It's on the street level so no real views as such, but it's light and airy and you can open the windows securely. The bedding is very comfortable - we had two adults and two kids that slept on the pull out beds in the lounge. There is a good selection of kids toys / DVDs. Everything is clean and tidy and very comfortable for a week's holiday. \n\nThe only thing that could be improved is that the apartment has not been updated recently and it feels like it could do with a refresh in terms of fresh paint, fixtures and fittings, but to be fair this is a really minor point in terms of the overall experience. \n\nThe overall complex is safe and secure and has a welcoming reception in the lobby. The pool is good for kids, clean and safe with a sauna. The spa pool (jacuzzi) was not hot while we were there. There is a small restaurant in the lobby where you can buy breakfast for $10.\n\nHost: Tabitha was very responsive and excellent to deal with and met us to welcome us into the apartment on the first day, and made everything very seamless, and facilitated a late checkout which was really helpful on our last day.\n\nOverall: Two thumbs up! Really enjoyed our holiday and we slept very well and loved our stay.

The studios cooking facilities were unsuitable for home cooking providing only a microwave and a toaster and a george Forman grill that didn\u2019t really work too well.

The access to the roof to view the Sydney fireworks on NYE was an added bonus.\n \nIt is situated in a large block on busy Bondi Road where there are a massive amount of amenities. There are many restaurants, ranging from simple to more up market, takeaways, ranging from the simple to high quality fish and seafood and a number of good bars and coffee shops. Catering for yourself is also easy with a number of small supermarkets and delis. Transport is also easy with numerous buses every hour running to Bondi Beach (takes 5 mins) and in the other direction the city (takes 25-30 mins). Well situated for Sydney Cricket Ground - 15 minutes on bus, followed by short walk. \nBondi Beach is a busy resort with plenty of bars and restaurants and of course the famous beach. There is a beautiful clifftop walk from Bondi that takes in Bronte and Cogee beach amongst others. \n\nThe studio itself is small but space is maximised and it has everything you need. The fridge and larder were well stocked with staples plus a few extras in the way of food we hadn't expected. Simple meals can be cooked on the 4 ring hob. There was a nice breakfast bar to eat at. The living area was very comfortable with tv and the bed allowed for a good night's sleep. Wardrobe and cupboard space was plentiful. The bathroom was small but had a good shower and Loretta supplied plenty of toiletries. There was a nice outside balcony with table and chairs. A little too warm to use in the full sun of the day, but ideal for dinner in the evening.\n\nThere was a great pool on the rooftop of the block and from there great views of Bondi Beach and the city. The Wifi provided offered a strong and reliable signal and the communal laundry is situated just a few doors down the hall. We did not need the parking but it is available on the bottom floors of the block.\n\nNice touches were the beach umbrella and several umbrellas which came in handy on one or two occasions with the rain.\n\nI would thoroughly recommend Loretta's studio to anyone wishing to visit Sydney.\n\nPeter Crane", "submitted_on": "2018-01-08"}}, {"model": "review.Review", "pk": 239996774, "fields": {"id": "239996774", "review_type": 0, "provider_id": "2357596", "visitor_id": "66246298", "listing_id": "475512", "rating": "96", "content": "Wonderful place!", "submitted_on": "2018-03-03"}}, {"model": "review.Review", "pk": 248168901, "fields": {"id": "248168901", "review_type": 0, "provider_id": "2357596", "visitor_id": "34600912", "listing_id": "475512", "rating": "96", "content": "We stayed at Loretta\u2018s for two weeks and it was the perfect vacation.

The kitchen is well stocked and has everything you need. The aircon is needed as the morning sun heats up the lounge very quickly. The home is set up well for kids with plenty of board games and a cot for the young ones. \n\n$100 for cleaning seems a bit rich. When you find things are less than spotless. For someone who has a big allergy to dust to look up and see all the fans are caked in dust is a off putting. The front room never gets dark as the blinds don\u2019t shut out any light. You also can here every conversation someone is having from the surrounding homes. None of the doors to the bedrooms close properly so during the night every time There is a draft the doors bang.\n\nRohan as a host though is great and responds to anything you ask straight away.

PHOTOS are same but not accurate , They are professional photos and apt itself if much older and less pleasant than in photos. Balconies were dirty... For $4635 USD I was expected something better and different ..\nI asked her to let me know 24 hrs ahead if she need to come into apt but no she emailed me 5 mins before Im going to come in 5 mins with 2 other guys to fix the taps which was broken and water was coming down on the floor on both bathrooms. Unfortunately they didn't fix it and we had apt entire period with a water in bathrooms...\n\n2 weeks later I asked her that I would like to leave 1 week earlier if she would give me a refund of last 7 nights and she said yes no problem, I told her I would like to do it only if she will give us full refund of 7 nights and she agreed but on last day she got another booking and she decided to give me only half she said you didn't stay one month and I took 10% discount off . So we needed to pay more price nightly , she letted apt to someone for one week where she was making more money as weekly price is higher than monthly but she decided to make money out of me too. I contacted airbnb and told them I was not leaving apt until I would get full refund which I finally got it after long discussion and stress. It was worst airbnb experience in my life.

One night we ate at the Japanese restaurant next-door to the apartment and it was delicious (get the sashimi and/or a bento box). Things I particularly liked about the apartment, in addition to location, included fast wifi, really good washer and dryer, kitchen that included things like tea bags and cereal when we arrived.

Super lovely and convenient! The Penthouse is also located in close proximity to major tourist attractions, so we walked to the Sydney Fish Market, The Star, and Darling Harbour. Everything else is easily reached with a cab/Uber within 5 - 10 minutes. The apartment itself was very spacious and clean, and the view is amazing (you can see the Anzac Bridge from the living room). One thing that can be improved is to put an AC in the third bedroom. Since we were visiting during the summer, the room gets very hot, and you can't open the window (it's permanently locked due to government regulations) for air circulation. The fan that's provided in the room doesn't really help. You can't sleep well in there because it's uncomfortably hot.

We can tell she takes great pride in her space since it is very stylish and well kept. From the moment we arrived it was clean, airy and looked just like the pictures advertised. Location is superior, you are very close to it all! Now if I was to be picky there are two minor items I'd like to reiterate. Carole did mention this in her listing but please allow me to say:\n\n1. When she meant there are stairs, well there are stairs! Not only getting to  her apartment on the top level (which is nice since you won't have noisy neighbors above). It also starts from Sydney road all the way up to Tower street. On a cool winter day I suppose this won't be an issue but on a very hot summer day this can be a problem considering there is no air conditioning in the apartment which brings me to the second minor item.\n\n2. Lack of air conditioning. Again if you read her listing carefully she mentioned there are no air conditioners so it shouldn't come as a surprise. Lucky for us we were in Manly when the weather wasn't super hot so we were able to tolerate the heat with the ceiling fans. If it was on a very hot day however, it might've been a different story.\n\nAll in all, we really like Carole's place and would stay again perhaps when the weather is cooler and not in the middle of summer. That is just our preference but please do not take our minor drawbacks as a reason not to stay here. If you are perfectly fine to no air conditioning in the summer months and not bothered by a fair amount of stairs then consider this place. The cleanliness, thoughtfulness and stylish decorations will make it worth your while.

It is 5 min away (on foot) from the bus stops, where you can find buses to go to U of Sydney. It is 15 min away (on foot) from the Newtown Train Station. On your way between the airbnb and the Newtown Station, you will find many cafes, restaurants, and launderettes. \n\nBasically you find everything you need in Christopher's place. Wifi, a kettle to make tea, a toaster, a small fridge, a portable heat and a fixed heat on the wall, a tub, dishes and cups and so on. I often buy food from grocery stores and make simple meals at home. \n\nThe place feels like a home. Thus it is ideal for a couple, especially those who are 30+. People who share the place must feel very close to each other. In fact I cherish this closeness and I will love to choose the place again in the future.

The refrigerator was cleaned out, but the cabinets literally had no space for any food we might buy. We put it on the counter.

It was exceptional value for the price and made us feel right at home. 10/10\n\nLocation - To be honest, after booking we were a little concerned that we were positioned too close to Kings Cross, but we were really pleasantly surprised. The neighbourhood was gorgeous, and we were far enough away from the cross to have peace and quiet, but close enough to access the metro station- there was also a great market just down the road on the Saturday morning which was awesome. 10/10\n\nHost - Sophie was a terrific host, her communication was brilliant, and she was very accommodating in allowing an earlier check-in and check-out to suit with our arrival and departure times. She also provided us with some really god local tips, which were all on point. 10/10", "submitted_on": "2018-06-17"}}, {"model": "review.Review", "pk": 278362697, "fields": {"id": "278362697", "review_type": 0, "provider_id": "4424088", "visitor_id": "3521815", "listing_id": "1253351", "rating": "98", "content": "It came as no surprise after reading all the reviews that Sophie was the hostess with the mostess.

There is enough room for one full size luggage on the floor, then you must hop over it to get to the bathroom. We had two carry on luggage and very little room to move around without bumping into each other.  This accommodation is absolutely not for overweight couples (an inside joke for Edward, the owner).

The second person can always stand in the bathtub. LOL. The shared area is upstairs. There are peek a boo views of the water, wrap around patio, a very dirty kitchen and living room and dining room; bright sun filled rooms with a lot of clutter around. We were told we could use the shared area\u2019 s TV since the owner was away and we were asked not to cook anything on the stovetop. It can be very claustrophobic if you have to only stay in the bedroom in the basement. The wifi did not work in the bedroom. The house is not air conditioned. The washer and dryer in the basement closet, we were told does not work. The house is quite close to Bondi Beach (5-10 minute walk) but it is located on a steep hill which may be difficult for some people to hike up to. There is a bus that comes close to it that you can catch from the beach. (Not sure about the frequency or the schedule). As the owner was away, we had to contact a different care taker in order to check in.  Double check contact info provided to you.

Same to reach a small shopping center, 10-15 minutes away by bus (+ waiting time). With one change, you reach Maroubra or other beaches or a big shopping center. We cooked in the apartment, no problem for basics. The kitchen is quite new and has enough space. We appreciate the large fridge, freezer and dishwasher. The laundry is to be shared with the owner and you can usually dry the clothes in the sun. We appreciated the big shower, hot and stable temperature and the bathroom in general. The flat is airy even on hot days, except the main sleeping room. We did not need the provided fans. In the sun room you can let the door open and hear the waves at night (but then also a bit of traffic). The sun room couch bed is very soft (flabby?). For one person just ok. But I wouldn't want to share it. We appreciated the moskito nets everywhere. Kitchen and bath were very clean but the floors and shelves could have need a bit more care.

The hosts were lovely and great communicators, and the apartment was a great size and comfortable. The location is also amazing, and the building has great amenities (gym, pool, etc). However, I experienced a serious breach of security and invasion of privacy during my stay. I arrived home one night to find that someone had entered my apartment, uninvited and without my permission or without me receiving notice. I feared for my safety, as I did not know if I had been robbed or if anyone was still inside. It turns out that it was a cleaner and there was a miscommunication between the cleaner and the hosts about dates. However, this incident was unacceptable. I paid extra to stay close to my workplace in a secure apartment to ensure my safety. This incident made me feel very unsafe. The hosts offered $50 compensation for this incident, but I will never be staying in this property, or using Airbnb, again. Additionally, when I arrived at the apartment, it was quite dirty. The microwave was covered in food and everything was generally dusty. There was also rotting food left in the bid when I arrived, which leaked when I removed the bin liner. There was dirty paper towel and hair left in the bathroom sink. I am not sure what the cleaning fee is used for! The pantry basics the host said were provided were also old and out of date, so not useable. Some pantry basics weren't even provided, although I was assured they would be. Additionally, the apartment was lacking things like paper towels and baking paper for the oven. The host quickly came to clean the microwave and brought new paper towels, which I appreciated. She also replaced the wine glasses (which were missing from the apartment when I arrived), and gave me a bottle of wine to apologise. This was a thoughtful gesture, but the experience was disappointing all the same. The furniture in the apartment is also dated and old, and not modern like the listing said. The couch in the photos is not the same as the one in the apartment. The one in the apartment is much older and dirtier. The spare bed in the study, mentioned in the listing, was not a proper bed. The cutlery and knives in the apartment were also dirty and dated. The cooking knives are dangerously blunt and most were dirty, making them unusable. I highly recommend that these are urgently replaced. The bed linen and pillows were also yellow and stained with age, and need to be replaced. The host also had me do an \u2018errand\u2019 for her, which I was not pleased about. A previous guest had left some belongings behind, and the host had me deliver them to reception. Overall, I expected much more for the price I paid for this apartment.

Outstanding beaches minutes by car in every direction (there are at least seven within 15 minutes!), a plethora of cool little cafes and eateries within a stroll or short drive from the house and in the surrounding area, and the proximity to Sydney and other area attractions make this little part of the world a can't miss. \n\nThe place itself is both stylish and laid back with a large deck in a bush-like setting where tropical birds literally swoop down daily to eat from your hand. You can see both the bay and the sea from the deck, and the sunsets are lovely.  The house great for kids, with a trampoline out back a tons of toys and books available. Our six-year-old loves it. There are four bedrooms, two I would characterize as \"adult\" rooms with beds big enough for two people and then two rooms perfect for kids. Two full bathrooms is also nice. The open plan living room, dining room, kitchen is a great space to relax and the TV/Wifi/Chromecast was nice to have on hand. Zoe was a great host both times.\n\nThe only knock is that the house did have a bit more wear and tear than our last visit, which is understandable since it had been two years. However the porch and sliding doors have just been redone to incorporate the outside space more and it looked like a backyard revamp was getting started.\n\nOverall, Zoe's place has become one of our favorite in the world (and that's saying a lot from a couple on country 44).

The location is lovely, a beautiful area, quiet and peaceful with tree lined streets and stunning homes. Even though we were travelling with 2 little kids (4 yrs and 9mths) without a car, we found it easy to walk everywhere with our double pram and access to the ferry was an enjoyable walk (we used Milson's Point ferry station rather than Kirribilli station which is a bit closer but has steps going down to the station). The ferry system in Sydney is very easy to navigate and is prompt and reliable. It's also only a short walk to cafes and restaurants which we enjoyed for breakfast and lunches, though we ordered in a lot of the nights as it was easier with the kids to get them to bed and then we could just enjoy the best view than anywhere else! We loved watching the harbor activity from the outdoor balcony or from the comfy sofa by the window. My four year old was very excited to see the cruise ships come in at dawn. We made the most of our days with our early starts! Those travelling with kids, just be aware that there are steps form the footpath to the apartment entrance and then another flight of stairs to get onto the passageway that goes to the apartment's door. We had to fold up our pram to get in, but if you just had a single pram, I think you would be fine. There are a couple of small supermarkets nearby and a bottle shop which are great to collect bits and pieces, but I did an online Woolworths delivery to arrive on our first day which made it really easy and I would recommend other families do this.  Although we didn't meet Alastair in person, the check-in and check-out procedure was very easy. Alastair was extremely prompt and polite in getting back to my questions and requests and was very accommodating with allowing a later checkout which allowed us to have a stress free morning before taking our onward flight. The apartment is well equipped and had all that we needed. The beds were comfortable and made up with nice linen, a good new port-a-cot and high chair provided and plenty of towels.

In the booking notes, you are warned that the cleaners may still be there at 2pm and you will have to leave and return after 3pm. We arrived at 2.15pm/2:20pm and the cleaner was still there, she said she was almost done and we were fine to wait which was really appreciated. I have mentioned to Alastair it would be handy if guests could receive the heads up on the day if this is likely to occur. We had an overtired 7 month old baby and had been driving around since our plane landed at 9am so we would have kept her sleeping in the car if we had known the apartment wasn\u2019t ready. Also the cleaners arrived 10 mins early on checkout. Again, these minor issues definitely wouldn\u2019t deter you from staying in the apartment, just something to be aware of.
